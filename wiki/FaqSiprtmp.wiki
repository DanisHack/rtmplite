= Frequently asked questions (SIP-RTMP gateway) =

=== My gateway does not work. What do I do? ===

Please start your gateway with "-d" command line option, so that it prints detailed trace information including the SIP messages. Then capture the trace, e.g., using Unix "script" command. Finally, send your error report and the trace to [mailto:myprojectguide@googlegroups.com support].

=== Does it work with other SIP servers or clients? ===

Depends on what the other SIP client or server is. If there are interoperability bugs, we will be happy to resolve those.

=== When dialing out from web client, should I dial phone number or SIP address? ===

You must dial a SIP address of the form "user@domain" or "user@ip-address". If you have PSTN dialing available via your gateway, then use the "phone-number@ip-address-of-pstn-gateway", e.g., "7140@192.1.2.3" instead of just "7140". 

=== When I call from X-lite it responds with "488 Incompatible SDP". Why? ===

By default X-lite has only PCMU and PCMA codec enabled. You will need to go to audio options of X-lite and enable the Speex/16000 (wideband codec).

=== Does it work with Asterisk? ===

Depends on what codec Asterisk supports. The siprtmp gateway supports speex/16000 or 8000 (audio) and x-flv/90000 (video). From what I understand, the Asterisk codec does not support speex. You can compile Asterisk to support speex using speex/8000 and not speex/16000. The VideoPhone and siprtmp gateway now have support to dynamically switch from default 16000 (wideband) to 8000 (narrowband). Please see the next question on how to make siprtmp work with 8000 Hz sampling.

=== How can I use Speex/8000 (narrowband) instead of Speex/16000 (wideband) ===

Flash Player by default uses 16000 Hz sampling for Speex. The new version of siprtmp and rtmplite (version 6.0 and above) support both 8000 and 16000 Hz sampling for Speex. In the VideoPhone Flash application, you can select the narrowband (8000) Speex in the right click menu. The right click menu allows you to switch between narrowband and wideband. The selection must be done before registration, but is saved along with you other registration data if you select "Remember me" option. The selection is supplied to the siprtmp.py gateway in the NetConnection.connect method as the rate attribute, and is used for audio format sampling rate.
